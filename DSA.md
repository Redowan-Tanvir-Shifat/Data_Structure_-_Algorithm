## Introduction
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of computer science and programming. Mastering DSA is essential for solving complex problems efficiently and effectively.

## Types of Data Structures

### Linear Data Structures
1. **Array**: A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
2. **Linked List**: A sequential collection of elements called nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
3. **Stack**: A LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.
4. **Queue**: A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.

### Non-Linear Data Structures
1. **Tree**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes.
2. **Graph**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them.
3. **Hash Table**: A structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup.

## Algorithm Basics

### Time Complexity
- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
- **O(n)**: Linear time
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time

### Space Complexity
Space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to execute.

## Common Data Structures

### Arrays
- Fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.
- Operations: Access (O(1)), Search (O(n)), Insertion/Deletion (O(n)).

### Linked Lists
- Types: Singly, Doubly, Circular.
- Operations: Insertion/Deletion (O(1) at head), Search (O(n)).

### Stacks
- Operations: Push, Pop, Peek (all O(1)).
- Applications: Expression evaluation, Backtracking.

### Queues
- Types: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue, Deque.
- Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue (O(1)).

### Hash Tables
- Efficient for lookups (O(1) on average).
- Used in caching, database indexing.

### Trees
- Types: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, B-Trees.
- Traversal: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder.

### Graphs
- Representations: Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List.
- Traversal: BFS, DFS.

### Dynamic Programming
- Solve problems by breaking them into overlapping sub-problems.
- Examples: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem.

### Greedy Algorithms
- Make the best choice at each step.
- Examples: Activity selection, Huffman coding.

### Divide and Conquer
- Break problems into smaller sub-problems, solve them independently, and combine results.
- Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
